# Fire-detection-and-alert.
Hi ! Here I have tried to use open cv library to detect fire.
Trained camera with Open CV, Computer vision will detect flame or  fire.
 
Instantly  and  will automatically start  fire alarm, send  SMS, email  to fire station.
 
Functionalities similar to a household fire and flame detector.
The  change is replace the flame sensor with a long range trained camera . 
Camera will ensure more area coverage than the conventional fire detectors.

The 2nd phase already done : Automate the process with fire extinguisher,exhust fan for removeing dark thick smoke, signal light blink etc .

Please watch the video on youtube. Link : https://youtu.be/s10BgJhR4GM

If trained, the camera can detect smoke also.

Thank You.
