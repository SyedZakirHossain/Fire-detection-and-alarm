# Fire-detection-and-alart.
Hi ! This event i have tried to use open cv library to detect fire.
Trained camera with Open CV, Computer vision will detect flame or  fire.
If trained it can detect smoke also. 
Instantly  and  will automatically start  fire alarm,
send  SMS, Email  to fire station. 
Functionalities similar to a household fire and flame detector.
The  change is replace the flame sensor with a long range trained camera . 
Camera will ensure more area coverage than the conventional fire detectors.
The 2nd phase : To automate the process with any fire extinguisher.
Thank You.
